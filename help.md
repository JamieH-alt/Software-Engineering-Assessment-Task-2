# Dungeons And Critters Help Page

Welcome to Dungeons And Critters! This guide will help you understand the game's basics and controls.
Gameplay Loop

## Dungeons And Critters has two main types of locations:

*    Outside Locations: This is where you'll start your adventure. You'll move between different towns and dungeons. Be careful, as travel between locations can be timed and might even lead to unexpected encounters!
*    Inside Locations: Once you enter a town or a dungeon, you're in an "Inside Location."
*       Towns: These are safe places where you can walk around, interact with buildings, and prepare for your journeys.
*        Dungeons: Dungeons are dangerous areas where you'll engage in text-based combat simulations.

## Moving Around
### In Towns:

You move around in towns by using directional commands.

*    up: Move your character up.
*    down: Move your character down.
*    left: Move your character left.
*    right: Move your character right.

### Interacting with Buildings:

When you move onto certain tiles in a town, you can interact with buildings:

*    I (Inn): Enter an inn to rest and heal your health. Type rest to heal.
*    B (Blacksmith): Visit the blacksmith to buy items. Type buy [item_name] (e.g., buy Shortsword) to purchase an item.
*    A (Adventurer's Guild): You can enter the Adventurer's Guild, but currently, there are no quests available.

### Exiting a Town:

To leave a town, move your character onto an 'E' tile. This will bring up the travel menu.
